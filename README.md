## Material-UI Practice Project: A note taking app

This project was developed as a hands-on practice opportunity for material-ui. It involves all the basic and complex concepts of material-ui such as `Themes`, `Make Styles`, `AppBar`, `Drawer`, `Form`, and `TextField`

This project also uses `json-server` to incorporate the CRUD functionality using a dummy REST API.

Download the code & run **npm install** to install dependencies before starting the app.
